Fix crackling noises from audio outputs of VoiceMeeter, VoiceMeeter Bannana and VoiceMeeter Potato.

## How to use ?

Download this program from the "Releases" menu on the right of the page or by clicking on this <a href="https://github.com/TheRake66/VoiceMeeter-Crackling-Repair/releases/">link</a>.

This program is used to automatically change the priority of the "audiodg" processes from normal to high and to define the affinity of the processes on the last core of the processor.

This can fix mic cracking and bobble voice issues on Discord or OBS when using VoiceMeeter, VoiceMeeter Bannana, or VoiceMeeter Potato.

You can also place this program in the Windows startup folder so that it happens every time you start the computer.
